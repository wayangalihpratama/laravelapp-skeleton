# Product Brief — Batuan Village Tourism Website

## Problem Statement

Batuan Village (Desa Wisata Batuan), located in Sukawati district, Gianyar regency, Bali, is a culturally significant tourism village with over 1,000 years of history. Despite being world-renowned for its distinctive painting style, ancient temples (Pura Puseh, 1022 AD), traditional Gambuh dance, and master artisans — **Batuan Village has no official tourism website**. Visitors currently rely on scattered information from third-party tour operator sites, resulting in:

- Loss of narrative control over the village's cultural brand
- Missed direct engagement opportunities with potential visitors
- No centralized platform for event announcements, art showcase, or tour booking
- Falling behind competitor villages (Penglipuran, Desa Mas, Pemuteran) that have dedicated web presences

## Target Users

| Persona | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **International Tourist** | Traveler planning a Bali trip, searching for authentic cultural experiences beyond mainstream spots |
| **Domestic Tourist** | Indonesian traveler interested in "Desa Wisata" experiences and Balinese art |
| **Art Enthusiast / Collector** | Person interested in Batuan painting, seeking artist info and purchase channels |
| **Tour Operator / Travel Agent** | Professional packaging itineraries who needs reliable village information |
| **Researcher / Student** | Academic studying Balinese art, culture, or heritage preservation |

## Value Proposition

> **"The official digital gateway to Batuan Village — where a thousand years of Balinese art, spirituality, and tradition come alive."**

A beautifully designed, bilingual (English/Indonesian) website that:
1. Showcases Batuan's unique cultural assets with immersive visuals
2. Provides practical visitor information (hours, maps, etiquette, pricing)
3. Promotes local artists and their galleries
4. Enables tour/visit inquiries and event announcements
5. Preserves and digitizes centuries of cultural heritage

## Competitive Landscape

| Village Website | Strengths | Gaps Batuan Can Fill |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| penglipuran.com | Clean design, ticket info | Lacks art focus, no gallery showcase |
| desawisatamas.com | Wood carving emphasis | Limited interactivity, basic design |
| pemuterancoastalvillage.com | Eco-tourism, marine focus | Different niche — coastal vs. cultural village |
| Tenganan (via visitbali.id) | Heritage village content | No dedicated site — just listings |

**Batuan's differentiator**: The **only** Balinese tourism village that can claim a globally recognized painting art style, 1,000+ year temple heritage, AND living traditional dance performances.

## Constraints & Assumptions

- Built on the existing Laravel + Inertia + React stack (laravelapp-skeleton)
- Filament admin panel for content management
- Must be mobile-responsive (majority of tourism searches are mobile)
- Image-heavy — needs optimized media loading
- Content initially provided by the development team (placeholder-quality) with a CMS for village administrators to update
- No e-commerce/payment integration in MVP (future consideration)
- Hosting and domain are outside scope of this phase
